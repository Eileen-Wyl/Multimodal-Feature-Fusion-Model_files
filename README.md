# QSCP_files
The repository contains an archive of scripts and data files that can be used to reproduce the development and validation of QSCR models that predict explosion diameters based on chemical structures. The library was established at the request of the Journal of Chemical Informatics.
Make sure you have installed the Python libraries you rely on in your code, such as pandas, numpy, torch, scikit-learn, bayesian optimization, and so on. Next, place the CSV file in the directory where the code file is located (or modify the file path in the code to point to the correct file location) and run the code file smiles.py directly. The code will automatically load data for pre-processing, extract features by the SMILESTransformer model defined, search for the optimal model parameters using Bayesian optimization method, and finally train the final SVR model and evaluate it on the test set, and output evaluation indicators such as MSE, RÂ², RMSE and MAE.
